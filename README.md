Angular JS - UI State Routing - Example code

I have created this sample code in a visual studio 2015 new MVC project. I have removed the packages while uploading to GIT as it has become oversize. 

This is a sample example of state based routing using HTML pages (in reality it doesnt even need a visual studio solution :-) )
